Small utility website I made on one of my live streams to teach people about the basics of image processing. Current version of the site takes a 64x64x64 (512px wide, 512px tall) Hald image in `.png` format and converts it to a `.cube` format LUT that users can use in any appropriate application.

This helps you archive your filters in a software agnostic way.
